# Global Norm MI Estimator

This repository provides implementations of **global normalized KSG** and **global normalized MINE estimators** for estimating mutual information (MI). The repository includes examples to help you get started with these estimators and visualize results on the information plane.

## Getting Started

- To use the **global normalized KSG** and **MINE estimators**, refer to the examples provided in `test.ipynb`.
- To plot the **information plane** with different estimators, refer to the examples in `NN_dynamic.ipynb`.



## Estimators Included

- **KSG (Kraskov–Stögbauer–Grassberger)**: A popular nearest-neighbor-based MI estimator.
- **MINE (Mutual Information Neural Estimation)**: A neural network-based method for MI estimation.
- **Binning Estimator**: Estimate MI via binning samples and approximate density.
